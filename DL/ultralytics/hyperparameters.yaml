# starting learning rate for the optimizer. higher learning rate 
# can speed of training but too high can make training unstable.
lr0: 0.01  # Initial learning rate

# rate the model will decay to over the course of training. 
# lower final learning rate can help the model to converge 
# more accurately.

# helps accelerate gradients vectors in the right directions, thus leading
# to faster converging

# L2 penalty. added to loss function to prevent overfitting 
# by penalizing large weights

# Initial learning rate for bias parameters during learning. 
# Specifically for bias terms in the layers
warmup_bias_lr: 0.1  # Warmup initial bias learning rate
